```
The script for creating database with an input list of artists and wiriting View and Query statements
is `main.py`. This is the only script to execute to run the project.

The dependencies for running `main.py` are found in `Python_Modules` folder:

* `spotify_db.py` - has the code for the custom database class using
    SQLite3 and class methods for creating, connecting to, inserting
    and querying to the database.

* `data_ingestion.py` - holds the functions for making the Spotify API calls,
    ingestion of data, formatting and transforming data, and creating the 
    database tables for the given database.

* `data_viz.py` - functions for creating and saving plots

### Python Requirements

The following python packages are required to be installed to run the scripts in this repository:

* `seaborn`
* `spotipy`
* `sqlite3`
* `numpy`
* `pandas`

### Data Format

The following tables describe the columns and their respective datatypes for tables in the Database
